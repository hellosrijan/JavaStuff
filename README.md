# Just some Java Stuff!

## 1. Calculator [`Main Calculator`]:
This calculator handles the common error raise when we're dealing with floating numbers.
This error is not specific to java only. It's in every programming language.

In the case of a computer, the number of digits is limited by the technical nature of its memory and CPU registers.
The binary notation used internally adds some more difficulties.
Computers normally can't express numbers in fraction notation, though some programming languages add this ability,
which allows those problems to be avoided to a certain degree.
